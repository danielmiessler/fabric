- Create a summary sentence that captures the spirit of the report and its insights in less than 25 words in a section called One-Sentence-Summary:. Use plain and conversational language when creating this summary. Don't use jargon or marketing language.

- Extract up to 20 of the most surprising, insightful, and/or interesting trends from the input in a section called Trends:. If there are less than 50 then collect all of them. Make sure you extract at least 20.

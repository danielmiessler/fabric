Here is an example conversation transcript from a YouTube video, followed by some example items extracted from it. This will illustrate how a human would extract the information from the content.

  "transcript": "when I struggle with writing it's a signal to stop writing it's worth finding a flow because then you can ride that sometimes I write and I get a little bit contrived and it's because I made the bar so high what is it about writing it down that makes it have to be more perfect than saying it out loud right right right why do you think that there's so much bad business writing everyone's pumping out content I don't like the word content at all it's communication every team lead has to write what's called a heartbeat summarizing all the work their team did over the last 6 weeks it's searchable transferable easy to access I don't think enough companies do it can I stop there even go for it let's break this down when I think of entrepreneurs who can also write Jason freed today's guest is the very first person who comes to mind he's written four books more than a thousand blog posts and a bunch of interviews and he is a master in the art of communication most of the episode is focused on Pros his long for writing how he's written his books and his articles but we also got into the mechanics of how he thinks about titles and copyrighting but his single favorite thing to do and my favorite part of this interview was when we went into the founder letters where what he does whenever he launches a product is he writes a letter and what we did was we broke down two of them how does he think about writing how does he think about storytelling how does he think about poetry and word choice so let's get into it here's my conversation with Jason freed Jason I want to start with uh a really quick quote that you have which is don't write communicate and the thing that I like about this is I think it speaks to the essence of how you think about writing which is actually don't think about writing think about taking an idea from your head clarifying it putting it onto the page and get the idea from your head into the other person's brain yeah you know it's funny I was reflecting on this quote actually um recently and with through my son not with him but about him he's nine and he likes to make stuff well at least I would describe him as someone who likes to make stuff so he'll he'll have uh some cardboard and a copper pipe and some glue a glue gun and some tape and some stuff and he'll have this thing he wants to make like he wanted to make recently like a ring holder for my wife to put her rings on and we weren't going to buy him one of those things and uh he didn't have any money so he's like I'm going to make one of these things and he makes it and I would describe him as a maker but really I was thinking about like what he really wants in the end is the thing the making is just sort of the the step to get the thing he just want he wants the thing in the end he doesn't I don't know if he likes the making process so much that's how I kind of think about writing I do like writing but I like like the end product so much that the process is not really that exciting to me actually which is why I'm kind of a fast writer I don't spend a lot of time on my pieces I kind of want to get to something good and if I'm not there quick I throw it away Y and start over because I don't I don't want to get I don't want to struggle through the thing um I want to just communicate the thing in the end and if there's too much work to communicate I'll stop and start over well one thing that stood out is you have this YouTube video where you walk through your process of writing a piece yeah for ink magazine and what really stuck out that doesn't happen to me is sometimes I write and I get a little bit contrived and a little bit like okay now I'm writing I really need to focus and I just watched your temperament through the video and it never changed and there was um a real sense of calmness that you maintain when things weren't working well yeah try to like what's the point of struggling there's some point of struggling in other things I think like certain things we're struggling through through for me writing is not worth struggling through it's worth finding a flow because then you can ride that so I found at least for me when I struggle with writing it's a signal to stop writing not to keep pushing through the writing but to stop writing do something else and come back and often times don't come back to what I wrote but come back to a blank page and start over and try to get there quickly so the struggle I mean it is important to struggle through things in life that's how you're going to get better and stuff but I I feel like it's also a sign sometimes say this isn't working and you're probably not going to make it work and you're going to get more frustrated and the frustration is going to show up in the writing so kind of back off a little bit and then come back to it later but again with the clean sheet I'm not a big fan of like starting with something and working it to death until I get there it's just time to go time to move on and do you feel like that's general advice or do you feel like that that's Jason advice I think it's only fair for anyone's advice to be about them honestly now whether or not you can use that advice or someone else can use that as it's up to them but for me my experience is my experience I do what works for me and maybe that works for somebody else so these are just ideas that's where out in the world that someone might go yeah that's how I write or like I didn't think I was justified in writing that way or I didn't think I could do it that way but he's doing it that way it gives me confidence that I can do it that way and that's kind of how I look at it so I wouldn't tell you how to do it right who who am I to say how you should write just how I write well this really stands out as a as something that show up in the way you think about business and the way you think about writing is just this sense of like feeling that flow and it's just sort of Step by Step it's like is this the right flow and there's just this sense presumably that you have in your body and your mind of like when you found that right idea that sort of slipstream and then you can follow it that's how it feels I want to get into this effortless place where in in effect I don't really understand why things are coming out so well in a sense yeah you know like I'm I'm proud of the work at the end but I don't really understand how I got there sometimes I read a sentence and I'll be really proud of it and I'm like that's a good sentence I don't know where that came from but it's really good and I'm proud of that sentence and that kind of propels me through to the next one to the next one and then um there's also an aesthetic though to when I look at what I'm writing I can't exactly explain it but I'll look at a sentence and I'll say does that sentence look right like the letter forms does it look right is it too jaggedy or does it feel right or are the are the words too long and then too short and too like there's a there's something I try to get to where but it has to happen naturally is the point like I'm not going to replace a couple words because the shape of the word doesn't work for me as well I want to write something out and I'll look at it and go that feels good that feels nice just like you you you uh you come upon something you're on a hike or something and you find a branch like every once in a while I find a branch with like lyan on it I'm like that just looks good that's how I want my sentences to look that just looks good that there was no effort in that it just is and um when I find those lines it really kind of propels me through the piece and if I don't find one early I know it's not going to be good so I stop again throw it away come back to a layer I've heard people equated it to skiing I'm not a skiier so me neither so I might totally drop the metaphor but I guess that shooting free throws maybe shooting free throws who knows but I guess you're ski and then you kind of find this line you just sort of follow it when you're in a really good flow the line just sort of opens up and emerges actually okay we'll do a football analogy okay like I'm not a big football fan but I know I know football okay so basically like when you're running back you're sort of following what the line is is is doing they're trying to create a hole for you and sometimes it just sort of emerges but then you just got to run and I have found that when I'm writing there's there's certain times where I have to say I got to put the plans away I'm not coming to dinner like I found a hole and I need to run because that hole will close in 12 hours yeah you don't control the hole y it's just sort someone makes it for you or something makes it for you and you go and there's there was this time when I wrote this thing called the um 37 signals guide to internal communication I think it's called yeah yeah I read that and I wrote that in like an hour and it's long and I just couldn't stop like the the hole was open and I just felt like I just was in a flow and just kept going and I barely edited that piece at all and I felt really good about it at the end but that only happens when there's the hole again if I if I'm finding myself in the middle of it and I think it was like I don't know 30 points or something like that and then sometimes I'm like well I want to get to 37 because that's our 37 signals 37 but then I'm like then now it's contrived and I have to stop myself very quickly from going over the edge because once I go into that contrived place where I'm where I'm I'm efforting something too much it's going to be bad I really don't want it to feel like effort when it does then I feel like I'm in the wrong place yeah let me say this too when I when I read something I can sort of intu that that's how the auth I'm guessing here but that's how theth was feeling when they were writing into to like I'll read something I just read this book The over story you know this book Richard Powers yeah oh my God it was incredible it's p are prizewinning book so like I'm not the first person to say it but his writing style I just kept reading it I'm like man he must have been smiling when he wrote this that's how it felt there's some super clever lines and clever paragraphs and clever passages I'm like he must be so proud of himself at the end of that it's like that that nugget those six sentences together that just nailed it and I can just just imagine a smile or imagine a pride in that in the author that's what I want to get to I want to have that feeling when I write something what came to mind was like this sense of just oh my goodness it's just this awe this majesty and I've had many moments throughout the years where I've seen that and I've had that whoa moment and I've said I didn't even know that that was possible like a sense of Elegance that I want to recreate that book is full of that and I that's how I felt actually reading that book I was kind of shocked I don't read a lot of fiction and um I started reading that was the first fiction book I've read in a long time and now I'm like hooked on fiction so I want to get into more more fiction but that's how I felt when I read that book I go wow what a beautiful way to describe the unfortunate clear cutting of a huge Forest he described it as sort of um Coming upon this huge clearcut space this big arcing Hill that was clearcut of old trees and he described it like the stubble on a bald man's head which was just like my what a great way to describe like clearcut trunks are left short trunks are left and just like desolate emptiness nothing that's bald people man the the the thing that really stands out in that is sometimes you read that and you'll see something like that you feel like oh I need to try so hard when I write and you're using this word contrive like contrive needs like a big red danger side like do not go there yes because the way that that sort of Elegance often comes out is exactly what you were saying earlier I don't know where that came from it comes out of the intuitive world not the conscious world I I believe so I think most things that are good come off of the intuitive world the gut basically it's all gut you were talking about the 37 signals guide to internal Communications earlier yeah when you have a piece like that where does the Genesis moment how does that happen what inspires a piece like that is this a a a question that you keep getting a sense of frustration anger anger frustration yeah it's usually I'll read something or I'll hear something and someone will say like this is how we make decisions or this is how we communicate I'm like I need to share how we do it because this is like I just feel like this is wrong or you know it's wrong for us at least but like this should not be the only version of whatever this message is out in the world we have our own message so we usually develop software and I write from a place of frustration or anger is too strong but it's like a fun anger it's like oh that's okay okay yeah let me show you what we do or how will you do it so there there's this competitive spirit I think that that drives some of that for me but it's usually like one spark and then um again is is there a fire or does it just go out pretty quickly that it I really want to follow my gut on that so if if it keeps burning I'll keep going until it Peters out and that's kind of how that one was I rode it kind of fast but there was a lot there and I felt like it was pretty tight and concise it was probably repetitive in a few spots and I probably edited out some of that but um there was a point where I felt like I could only make this worse and that comes pretty fast I think in my writing at least I will tend to get too wordy if I keep working it right things tend to get longer as I keep working them versus getting shorter I usually start with the shorter version and that's usually the better version and it's the same way in software when I come up with an idea for a product or a screen and I sketch it the sketch is like the best version of the thing all from there on out it only gets worse in a sense just because the sketch of course doesn't take into consideration all the things that it has to actually do and we don't have to build the sketch it's just a picture you know but um when I overwork a sentence or a paragraph or a piece it's going to come out worse so I got to stop myself yeah how is that different from articles to books because I know that I think with rework you did a bunch of compression towards the end of the book so what is different about the nature of a book there part of part of there's a couple things um it's a very good question because there it is different but that book is made up of short essays um what we did was we took a collection of short essays and cut the short collection of short essays down by half basically our contract was like you have to produce 40,000 words or something like that because the book has to be this thick you know in the book world it's like it's thickness it's it's just thickness which is the weirdest me so we're going to put in drugs yeah yeah yeah so that's what we ended up doing but we we had we had these essays we're like you know what there's a really damn good half book here but this book as it is is too repetitive it's not right so we went and shaved it down by half and we handed it in and our editor was kind of horrified our editor was wonderful he was incredible but he was like we said 40,000 words this is going to be too thin we said just will you please read the book you know and and he read it and he said this is really good I'm really proud of this it's too short though and we said okay so is this just about length or is about subject matter this just about length Okay so we're going to add pictures we're going to tighten the margins we're going to increase the font size ever so slightly like let's work within the system let's satisfy the demands and the requirements that you have but let's kind of add other things to the book and it turned out I think it really made the book better to have a picture with with each book with each essay especially in business books You' never ever see that um so it was kind of a happy accident to have all that in there but we were not happy with the 40,000 words even though I think the essays individually were good but the collection of them was the problem if they were all spread out on the table or they were all published over 10 years individually I think we'd be happy with all the 40,000 words but when you look at a book it's a collection it's not a single essay it's a collection of things and the collection didn't feel right I often think of writers they sort of have their Zone it's sort of like sprinters where you know or like Runners there's some people who Sprint there's some people run marathons some people do 800 meters and I think that one thing that you've always done is you've never at least that I've caught tried to depart from the length that you do well so even going back to getting real it's like 90 short pieces and there's the same thing in rework and remote and it doesn't have to be crazy at work it's all that same sort of format and that format you've then developed with all these blog posts that you've written right and you haven't tried to say hey I'm going to write you know 10,000 words cuz that's what they do in the book publishing industry well I listened to your interview with Derrick sers who's like one of my favorite people and writers and the whole thing and uh he said it the same way I would say which is write a bunch of essays first essentially then you can sort of compile a book so I didn't set out to we never set out to write a book necessarily we never really set out to write a book except for remote remote we kind of did huh but but it doesn't have to be crazy at work rework and getting real getting real was actually a book but some of those things were posted as blog post first it's sort of a collection and then we then we modified and cleaned them up and made it like a singular voice cuz my writing style is different than David's writing style my business partner and so we kind of wanted to unify the things but typically we put out a bunch of says first to sort of establish it without thinking about a book in the future but eventually it's like we have a book's worth of material here can we turn this into a book it's not enough just to collect the essays but it's enough to have them first write them one at a time over many years and then put them together but your Sprinter analogy I was a sprinter oh okay um and uh finally a a sports analogy we canate I capped out at 400 the 400 meter for me was like it I could not run the 800 I I could run it but but I would I was bad yeah so like it's great the indoor 50 100 200 4x1 relay 4x2 like all those relays and I could run the 400 but if I tried to run the 800 no matter how hard I tried I would run it poorly I just am not built that way and it's a good way to think about writing because like if I can write a 400 or less essentially 400 meter or less essay I'll do that well but if I push myself further than that I mean you could say like maybe you should push yourself what's wrong with pushing yourself there's nothing wrong with that except to the point I don't actually enjoy writing long things I don't really like that so I think there's more of a it's more fun to be even though I'm a bit wordy In This Moment here but it's more fun to be it's actually more creatively challenging and intellectually stimulating for me to try to be concise with words in a way where I don't need to add anything more this is the thing it's short you get it and then you fill in the gaps so I really believe in allow in asking the reader to to think I don't want to lay it all out and give them no room to think like rework and our books they typically are suggestions but they're not really there's no calls to action it's not like do these seven things and you will become whatever it's like here's a point of view and we're just going to leave it out there and then you can think about I I like writing that way yeah how much of your rejection of precedent is something that you consciously cultivate and think about or how much of that is just temperamental in your personality well I think it starts with the personality then what ends up happening is you start to you start to like double down on your own stuff like for us to write a long book right now like not an essay based book but like a literally like a you know 30 page chapters or something would be it'd be hard for us to do that I don't think we're very good at it but also I don't think we would feel like it would be us right so uh it starts with with with what's natural and then I just want to stay within the natural realm I really think that the the thing I'm trying to get across here is that it's okay to know your limits and work within them and not feel like to become a writer you must write like someone else or you must emulate this style or if you're writing short essays you're not really a writer like a real writer would write a long essay or short means you don't have anything to say or what no it's like this is how you communicate get really good at that and be yourself just be yourself with your writing the thing I've always hated about writing um there go the eyebrows go up interesting oh tell me tell me tell me more was was was before was was when I had to write things I didn't care about in school um I had to write long it was all about length it was like long basically and subjects I didn't care about and uh it was miserable it was it wasn't even writing it was like um it actually I would just call it pointless that's what it was it was pointless it's like you write about this topic and make it 10 pages or whatever and then it's like that that I mean you kind of have to do that growing up to some degree but then you can not do that anymore and find your own way that's what's important I think yeah the thing that I just did not realize existed was the feeling of getting excited about an idea and skipping to the keyboard for the same reason that you're talked about earlier is I can't wait to see the end product which is the synthesis and Clarity yes of the in my head now on the page yeah it's exciting and sometimes it's frustr I mean often times it's frustrating not even sometimes often times it's frustrating to like to to to have this idea and not be able to communicate it and this is why I'm going to come back to something I said earlier I don't find that trying to struggle through it is the way through I really think you just got to stop and throw it away and start over and the other thing I often do is I'll just I'll talk I'll just like I try to write the way I speak versus having a right style that is separate from that and that makes it easier cuz then I can just go for a walk I often go for a walk I don't like actually like to sit still and think I like to move and think so I'll go for a walk and and and and just sort of like talk it out and go oh that's the line like there's there's usually like a line that gets me or there's like a combination of words or a title for the essay I need some hook that I have to find that brings me back to the um confidence that I need to pull it off and I'll try again confidence that I need to pull it off that's not what I was expecting you to say tell me more about that what were you expecting me to say a sense of direction okay I I kind of see them almost as the same thing perhaps I guess I guess that confidence almost implies a lack of confidence in in in what you would do so I don't think you meant it like that the the confidence for me in that moment is usually it's not the initial stab it's the coming back to something that I couldn't pull off the first time so if I'm working on an idea and I can't quite get it there I do need confidence to return to it because like the prevailing feeling at that point is like couldn't do it couldn't pull it off so you need to overcome that I think so when I go for a walk I'm kind of like in a way I'm spooling myself up to to and I'm looking for the hook I'm looking to find something that's going to work and then I'll go you know what this is um yeah yeah I think I got this again and then I'll sit down and I'll start writing again and it's got to flow and then then it does feel it feels like confidence it feels like confidence to keep going and finish the piece so I don't know if it is or not but that's how it feels to me how does editing show up the the best editor I've ever worked with uh was was on rework Tech um Rick Horan was our editor-in chief uh and he was awesome old school printed it out red ink you know like symbols I'm like I got to look these up that three D three lines under the thing what is that again or whatever um and F that's the first time I've ever worked with someone who really read the piece really really understood the piece really spent time thinking about it and worked hard to make it better and the edits did make it better I was skeptical I will tell you ahead of time maybe that's my overconfidence and my own skills or something but I was like what is an editor going to do that's how I felt and this like small little me thinking like what is edor going to do and um he really woke me up to being like oh this edor can really make this piece way way better and my ink editors were the same they didn't edit the piece in the same way but we talked through the things I find that it's easier to talk through improving writing than it is to look at another draft so when I would submit a piece for Inc they wouldn't come back with a revised version we'd hop on the phone and talk oh wow and that helped me I I like the conversation about writing more than like looking at another version of it it just doesn't really do it for me so I like I like the all the depth that comes with language uh verbal language and the conversation and the followup and what do you mean by that why do you think that's better you can never get to that in like a draft that someone presents to you you just get the final result then you have to ask like why this why that I prefer just to talk it out all the way um so working with editor was great um I will say when I write my articles I don't share them with anybody ahead of time I don't ask for feedback on them I just put them out there and I'll edit usually as I go sometimes I'll do a final read uh and you know even if there's a spelling error I just sometimes publish it and then like I fix it later right I don't I'm okay with that cuz it's not printed so I kind of feel like it's sort of okay even though probably isn't in a sense since I write like I speak if I make a mistake in a sentence like what I'm speaking I don't go back I mean sometimes I will like oh I meant to say that but usually you just kind of keep going and um I'm sort of okay with that like what is it about writing it down that makes it have to be more perfect than saying it out loud uh it's basically like saying it out loud but can't be there so hopefully other people read it and say it out loud to themselves and if there's a mistake like you it's not that big of a deal I mean I I want to make it right but also to what extent there's this this is a weird story I actually wrote about this once um I was in this um Navajo rug um gallery and uh I was looking at these Navajo rugs and they're really geometric and beautiful but they all were kind of like off in a way like the triangle wasn't quite like the the weren't right and there was some mistakes what I thought were mistakes and I asked the guy I said um why like why are there mistakes in these rugs and he said like you know this this is his interpretation uh the navigo didn't see that as a mistake he basically said like just like if you were walking on a path and you stumbled or you tripped or you took a slightly different direction you wouldn't back up and redo that section you just keep going it's just like yeah there was a thing it happened but you just keep going and he goes that's what they did with their stitches if they kind of were off a bit it didn't matter they just keep going just as they would if they were walking or doing something and I wonder if that in some ways gave me some latitude did not take like every not to take Precision quite as seriously and as long as the message gets through that's enough yeah I it's so funny that you say that so I was uh eating my overnight oats this morning oh good for you and and uh and I have two sets of basically bowls in my apartment I have the cheap bowls that I bought on Amazon that are Amazon Basics and they're black they're perfectly round there's they're spotless and then I have this one bowl it's blue um and it's got sort of some wwan patterns and I bought it down there and it's got all these little Nicks at this point and it's like very imperfect the bowl isn't even perfectly round the texture of it is sort of feels a little messy and stuff but I always pick up that bowl first I never eat from the Bland Amazon bowls before the wwan bowl because it has so much more character it has so much more life it is so much more human yeah right same thing it's yeah it's the wabisabi thing in Japan there's something about that now I should correct a spelling error like it does that doesn't make the piece better your in your point the Nicks and the chips make that bowl feel different to you in a way that feels better I don't think a spelling error makes the piece feel better but but I also don't care that 340 people saw it wrong and then the rest 10,000 more saw it right when I fixed it online it doesn't really matter that much yeah this is a a strange parallel that but it's somehow top of mind but there's that John Legend song where he says um all your perfect imperfections it's like he's pouring out his love and his praise and I think that we're talking about editing earlier I think this is the problem where a lot of editors destroy writing is they try to make it perfect and they don't honor the perfect and Perfections so no shade on my ink editors um but I had a few run-ins like that where there was like a sentence I wrote which I was really felt really good about and they kind of rewrote something and it was very it just felt like they were sterilizing it yes it's a great word yeah and I'm like no no it's okay if there's some bacteria on this or whatever right in my head I'm like that's yeah that might be better technically like there's words sometimes they would use I I can't remember any examples but it was like the more it was the correct word but I don't want that word I would like the way the other word sounded and felt and it was a little awkward and I kind of liked that and so that's one of the tricks with editors is to help help them or help you know I guess help them understand what you're going for in your writing it's for me it's not Precision it's not like it it's it's a feeling I'm trying to get across and this to sterilize something in some ways is to remove all the feeling like you walk into a space that's sterile maybe it's a beautiful Museum or something or it's a beautiful modern piece of architecture I love modern architecture I love old architecture but you walk into some modern architecture and it's too sterile it's cold everything's too perfect there's like three materials there's no dust anywhere there's nothing and you're like I don't really feel good in this space or I don't really want to touch anything and leave a fingerprint versus you walk into an old space it's patina it's worn it's been lived in uh maybe the ceilings are lower it's more human scale and you're like this is messy this is sort of whatever but I love this space and that's how I want my writing to feel is like kind of like a lived in and I want our design to feel this way like our products are designed differently they don't look like the industry's work the industry work is all kind of everyone's like deriving their style from Apple it's just like everything's like trying to be apple we're trying to be like the Cozy living room that's comfortable and it's precise enough but there's some attitude there there's some personality there's some Humanity I'd like to think at least and I'd like to have that in my writing as well yeah well I think that this is part of the problem with the keyboard itself is you have the delete key whereas if you have a typewriter you're handwriting you end up with all of these weird errors and these weird imperfections and you sort of go on these tangents and stuff like that and you're like ah I messed up but I kind of got to go with it sort of like the path that you were talking about earlier whereas with the delete key you can just look at the screen you can go delete delete delete delete delete and I just wonder if the delete key has contributed to a kind of Polish in contemporary right it's a good question I think you're probably right I mean also like grammar Checkers and spell Checkers and these things like look they can be useful I'm sure like in some cases but I think when they become a crutch and you lean on them and you're aiming for again like technical Precision there are some writers who are wonderful at that but I think it goes too far for most people and it removes themselves from the piece got to be careful of that so when you were working with the ink editors with the rework editors and you were having those conversations would you go back and rewrite the piece from scratch or would you go in and make line edits um both it depends on the piece so some of the pieces like some of the edits were so substantial they want us to really rework the piece and there's a point where I don't know where the point is it's not like 50% but there's a point where you just feel like this is moving around so much it's not the same thing anymore so let's not work from the same thing let's start over and they were right like this idea would have been better presented this way so I'm not going to try to take this ball of clay and turn it into something else it's just not going to be that anymore there's not enough material there anymore so we'll start over and other times it was just like nailing a few sentences or like whatever so it's it's both it's not a I'm not rigid in those in those ways um but I'm definitely not afraid of throwing out work right I don't think because I put it on the page it needs to stay there in spirit and you move it around like it can go and I'm not just talking about like a line I can talk I talk about like writing this much and it's like close the file don't save new right not even the delete key because you can undo that and I found myself undoing deletes like I want to like close the document open a new document so it's really fresh and start again yeah I also find that memory is an amazing tool for compression and focusing on what's important like your brain doesn't remember things that aren't important so if you need to rewrite the thing you have a thousand words the 250 that you actually remember is highly correlated with the best stuff 100% And I'm the same way with like to-do I don't Keep to-do lists is that right yeah I don't I don't I have like a few things I need to do every day that I want to focus on and maybe I'll forget to do one someone will probably remind me or whatever but I don't like to have this list that I'm staring at of the things I have to do I want to remember remember the things I'm supposed to do so I can think about I want to think about these things how do you structure your days running a company so that you still have time to write because it's obvious that it's paid off but it's one of those things like sort of like going to the gym like on a day byday it might not be the best thing that you can prioritize but on a year by-ear decade by decade basis obviously you should be going to the chym you know for sure um I am pretty unstructured I write when I have something to say I don't write when I feel like I need to write I only write when I have something to say so it could be something comes up earlier in the day at work there's like some thing we went through I'm like I should write about that or I have some other idea I should write or I read something I should write about that but I don't I don't set aside time every day to do this um or every week to do this I don't have a Cadence that's not like I need to write one thing a week there's times when I write a good thing every day for a few days you know it just it it I have to it's a feel thing for me the Gym's different like I have to go to the gym I have to work out with the trainer because if I don't I won't do it so I need an appointment for that I don't like appointments for writing or any creative things um except for when I'm learning something so like I'm learning drums right now I'm trying to learn Ceramics on a wheel you know and I need to go to an appointment to do that because there's someone waiting for me to teach you know but at some point I want to then not have the appointment and I want to do it because I want to do it but I have to get there and with writing I don't feel like if I said like I'm going to write from 11: to 1 every day or whatever these are just times like what if I'm not there mentally what if I'm not ready for it what if I had a bad call 10:45 now I have to sit down and write like I'm not in the mood so I don't do that I don't I don't schedule this the other thing is because I write quickly I can fit it in and in fact I'll often try to write things I wrote something a few days ago called separation um which which I really liked um and I I I had an appointment at 10:30 in the morning and I was like 1010 I'm like I'm going to write I have I've had this idea for a bit I'm like I want to write this now so I've only got 20 minutes and I'm going to publish it before this call so I like the compressed time frame like I'm just going to get this out and be done so sometimes I'll do something right before I'll write right before I have something else to do so I don't go on too long with it yep yeah the other implicit answer there was was just space and buffer yeah just having the space for that when you get inspired that you can actually sit down to right so I have a very open calendar everyone in our company does we don't share calendars so we're not I no one can take my time I can't take anyone else's time if you want to talk to me or I want to talk to you not talk but like if I want to schedule sometime I'll ask you hey do you have an hour do you are you free from 3 to 5 or three to whatever it is and we'll have a conversation about it and that because of that our calendars are open so I don't have to try to squeeze like I just told you that I tried to squeeze in a piece of writing in 20 minutes because I I kind of didn't want to let to go on too long but I don't have these short periods of time throughout my day I have buffers I've got lots of time so if it if if there's a calling if I'm called to write something because I have something to say then I'll just find the time in the day to do it there always will be time to do that I want to it's important for me in general I found that one of my biggest regrets on a daily basis is having things scheduled that I don't want to do in advance ain't that right right so if I want to write and I'm like I have no time this week to write I would be so upset it's like why I don't want to do that to myself so MH why do you think that there's so much bad business writing out in the world is it people trying to posture they're scared what's going on there all the above and probably a thousand more things um I'd say part of it stems probably from like MBA programs and business writing in in school which is like fake it's just like it's fake right like business plans like fake like business plan competition so you're like making up a fake business you're not going to start I don't think it's worth going through that exercise and I think it trains you to BS your your way through things because the whole exercise is BS so God you're getting really good at bsing and then it just sort of like you BS for three or four years and it just kind of becomes uh what you do what you practice what you get good at and that's kind of unfortunately what people get good at I think there's also um companies don't have a point of view that they're sort of don't have anything to say uh and they then make up the things they think other people want to hear so business is about selling in a lot of ways so like what does what do I need to say to convince this customer versus like what do I really want to say because we have something to say I don't think a lot of companies have anything to say they have a lot to sell and so they then write in that way and it's just like this is just flat and bad and jargony and empty and there's all the platitudes and I feel like you can replace this logo with that logo and it' be the same thing the different company saying the same thing then there's group think and there's all these things that happen in the business World um and it's a very conservative place and I think the writing becomes very conservative and people are afraid to say anything so uh and then also the other thing is like um a lot of companies don't invest in in writing in terms of like they don't have a copywriter they'll have someone else just write something because like it they need to write content I mean frankly like I don't like the word content at all it actually really bugs me because when you start thinking of things as content it's like it's like no there it's communication like what do you want to communicate now what do you want to put out there for SEO and whatever it's like content is just such a pejorative in my mind when it comes to writing so anyway but companies make content everyone's pumping out content and I think you get content when you do that and that's the kind of writing that you don't like and I don't like yeah I think that what it's revealing is a deep truth that many people are in business and Building Things and they have no idea why they're doing it yes and then in order to cover that up they're doing all this adding all this sort of fake and manufactured stuff to basically cover up the fact that there's know there there behind behind why they show up to work every day and the problem yes and the problem is that in business it's mostly following there's a few Innovative companies most companies follow and so they're following each other and like well they wrote this and they're popular so that must work and so I'm going to write in this style I'm going to write like that I'm going to copy them and uh and then it's all SEO driven and search engine driven and you know all the things where you have to pump it out and if you have to pump it out it's not going to be good probably you know um I'm not going to lie I think I've fallen into that so like I don't think I have two in the past so so so I don't think I'm above this and I this is I don't either by the way I've been there this is a really good transition into your founder letter because you love writing these and you've written them for hey and you've WR them written it for once um and I think that they're a really good example of how to show why you're building something yeah and basically if you're watching on YouTube we'll put it on the screen right now if you're listening tune in on YouTube for this section because we're just going to break down what it is that you're doing here I want to start off with how you start both of these which is you jump right into the problem so for the once you say something happened to business software can I stop there even go for it let's break this down yes so I wrote that line and I go I know this is going to be good now I know the whole piece is going to be good so for me it had to start with a good line and I like this format of a line so something happened to business software is is um the kind of line that injects a question into someone else's mind without me having to ask a question this is not a question it's a statement yeah something happened to business so so the reader is going to go wait what happened to business software and so now they're bought in because now they ask themselves a question and they want to get the answer um now this is not a trap it sounds like a trap it's not like manipulative it's just like I love those kinds of lines that lead with a little bit of mystery and make someone want to find out what the hell I'm talking about so I think that helps lead things in okay so you go right there and you wrote that first you didn't come back and write that lat no I wrote that first it's kind of I'm kind of pissed at this point you know what I mean there's an attitude here that I feel and is real and I have something to say about this and so this kind of leads me into that you used to pay for it once install it and run it whether on someone's computer or a server for everyone it felt like you owned it and you did yes and so now you're saying this what it used to be like and it's coming out hard but today most software is a service not owned but rented and we got to talk about owned and rented and landlords and all that jazz we'll get into that in a second buying it enters you into a Perpetual landlord tenant agreement every month you pay for a essentially the same thing that you had last month and if you stop paying the software stops working boom you're evicted is that cheesy I don't know it felt good I like endings paragraphs with a punch usually and the punches usually has to be short and it's sort of a summary it's an answer and it's like a this happened so that's other one it's like you owned it and you did it's like that sums up everything the next one is like boom you're evicted sort of sums up the the the Dark Side of rental basically yes um so I I that's a formula that I tend to like it's not something I do because I it's a formula it's like it turns out to be a formula it's it's emergent that's kind of how I like to write but I don't go there I don't say like I need to do one of those paragraphs with the thing at the end it's just how it comes out for me but when I can sum it up like that I know it's a good paragraph the end of the paragraph to me is what makes it good tell me about the Genesis of landlord tenant where did that come from that was by accident um actually as I was writing this um I was like you know used to own it and so I I like well now you don't so in my mind I go what's the opposite of owning it's renting now software is a Serv is never really talked about as rental that word is not does not come up it's almost like it's it's buried it's hidden people don't want to talk about the fact that it's rental software think about like what do you think of when you think of rental things well they're kind of beat up it's kind of you know used whatever you don't use that term and software but really it is rental in a sense um and I'm like I'm going to use that because while renting is great in a lot of ways and periods of your life or all the time whatever it is there is a dark side to rental that people have probably run into in their lives so now if I can frame this in a way that someone can can relate to an experience they had renting like their refrigerator doesn't work the landlord never fixed it there's a hole in the wall there's a leak you know all the landlord stuff all the yeah the bad landlord stories everyone has one somewhere right in college or or wherever they're living now whatever it is so now I can I can sort of personify SAS as a landlord and it kind of is uh and uh it's just a way to establish a little bit of a of a of a personification um here and then I I kind of let that live and let that sink in and then we move on here yeah for nearly two decades the SAS model benefited landlords handsomely with routine prayers and payers got to talk about that y to the Church of recurring Revenue yes we got to talk about all that stop there yeah so the payers and prayers thing was something that I struggle I like it but I struggle with because as you just bounced over it and kind of stumbled I stumbled writing it prayers prayers it's too close but I still went with it because I still like it a lot and it helps of course when you talk about church and whatever so but but I was a little bit worried that people would stumble over that because it is kind of hard to say um this this actually this's actually kind of happened and I'm memorate more happened in Reverse where I knew I wanted to use Church of recurring Revenue because I like that line and then um the pay the prayers and payers thing the alliterations it's not quite alliteration but like that feel bubbled up from the other statement and I go ah I like I like this now I like this play this is where writing becomes playful for me and then I know it's going to be good as well has to be playful I think I don't like to get too serious about this stuff and so I'm here I'm like Pairs and players and this is fun and I'm ripping on landlords to a certain degree like this is getting fun let me just stop you there real quick one thing that I love about play that I just realized is when you're playing you can't not be who you really are there's no such thing as play without personality and so I think that what play does is it brings out the personality that so many people are seeking yeah valuations shot to the moon on the backs of businesses subscribed at luxury prices for commodity services that they had little control over add up your SAS subscriptions like last year you should own that by now right I like that sentence right well I well I think that that kind of hits the boom you should own that by now and that's sort of the third big hit and you did that's the Revelation for me so it's a revelation it's like you're right I should own that ship by that's what I wanted to put in someone's head like yeah I've been paying for the subscriptions for years it's kind of the same thing yeah I'm getting new features but it's essentially the same thing these companies have been making tons and tons and tons and tons of money valuations through the moon I should own the ship but you're damn right I should like that's how I wanted I wanted to transfer this feeling into the person at that moment and go you damn right I should I had thought about that but yeah I should you know that kind of feeling so that's what that was about so now what you do is you have one more line here about SAS and then what you do is you begin to introduce once which is this line of products so tell me about that transition and then why you thought about the structure in this way of talk about the problem do a transition and then talk about once I want to get someone to to nod their head first so if I'm going to get um someone to agree with me later in a sense I kind of want them to agree with me first so it's kind of like you read the first half of this and you're probably going to go yeah yeah uhhuh yeah you're nodding I want to find this resonance like I'm nodding you're nodding and now you're open to hearing what I have to say I've described what I feel like is the reality and now here's what I want to bring to what I what I want to happen next what I what I think is that could be the new reality so that's why that that generally that format works well for me um I mean I've seen and when you look at great product demos it's the same way they kind of show a product and this is what's wrong with the product or the the category and like here's our solution it's just kind of a nice way to I think establish a reality get someone to go yeah and then they're open and then you have some fun with Once once once once once but what stands out is the way that you begin that is you say once once upon a time you owned what you paid for you controlled what you depended on and your privacy and security were your own business can I stop you there the name once which is this brand on.com that the name came from um writing that once upon a time thinking actually I didn't write thinking Once Upon a Time used to pay for software huh I'm like once is actually Once Upon a Time that's good I like that word it also since we're paying once once and Once Upon a Time like there's this double meaning there which I really liked and um so it the name of the thing actually came from writing and thinking about how to talk about the thing and then how do you think about now you have the basically five bullet points that you talk about with Once yes so why five bullet points why do you focus on those you say pay one time own forever you say we write the code you get to see it you say we give you the software you get to host it you say simple and straightforward not enterpris and bloed and then finally for one fixed price once so those bullets sort of follow the similar structure where the first half of the sentence is like the previous existance or reality and the second half is like the new the new things I like that pattern I like the bounce I like the Rhythm I like the bounce to me like if something's bouncing it's it's moving I like the movement in the words and the sentence and I think it pulls people through they're short they're Punchy yeah but hey let's go on to the hey letter so this one you open a little differently you say hey everyone I'm Jason Co here at 37 signals so what are you going for there yeah that that's a good question um when we launched hey which is an email service I launched it initially with a with just this letter this letter is currently on the existing site if you go down to the bottom of it but initially at hey.com it was just this and um it was just this for a few months so we didn't want to say exactly what we were doing but we kind of wanted to say something about what we were doing and in this case I felt like it was more of a personal letter that one the the once one is more of a statement this one felt more like a letter like I'm writing it to you and to say Hi here's my name it kind of opens it up in a more personal way um I don't know strategically why I went that route but it it just felt like the right thing to do if there's only going to be this it's less aggressive it's more like a love letter to email and so I want to open up in a in a in a happier thing than like a sharp statement one of the things though that does show up in both is it has the same structure of things used to be this way we loved how they were then they became broken and now we're trying to redeem the way the things are for how they should be structurally the same and I think what's important maybe about this if you going to drive anything is like again there's a there is a Formula here but they don't need to be the exact same formulas there's similar formulas like this one's more of a personal letter um you'll see at the bottom of this one my my avatar is in the bottom of this one the other one is not on the left-and side um my email address is on the left- hand side it's not on the right hand side like there's some CH some differences but strategically or H not even that structurally it is the same approach to getting a message out there which is to establish how it was or what's wrong with the current and what we're going to do about the the present it then says email gets a bad rap but it shouldn't email is a treasure it feels great to get an email from someone you care about or a newsletter you enjoy or an update from a service you like that's how email used to feel all the time and this is a feeling that is I want to get across early because most people don't like email but you're like I actually it's not that I don't like email like if I get an email from my wife like I like that I get an email from an old friend I like that my uncle who's 100 he sends me an email like I'm look when I see my my mom's Uncle my great uncle uh I'm like this is amazing like I want to read this so email is not bad what's become of email is bad but at its core it's still a wonderful thing it's a treasure so yeah I wanted people to go back go yeah I don't hate all email I hate the spam I hate like the the too many things you know emails from people I don't know that's the stuff I don't like but email itself is actually wonderful just like getting a letter in the mail is wonderful but you also junk mail do you hate letters right no you kind of like letters wedding invitations are great yeah amazing right yeah but things changed uhhuh you started getting stuff you didn't want from people you didn't know you lost control over who could reach you an avalanche of automated emails cluttered everything up and Gmail Outlook Yahoo and apple just let it happen right there's sort of the alliteration the AA I like this thing uh I like using the same letter start start words when I'm trying to be really have an impact I feel like it bounces well again so this Avalanche of automated emails avalanch automated like multiple syllable words together that's what creates the balance I'm thinking about this red ball if I'm doing red balls on syllables is there's a lot of balancing here and I like that I like that effect occasionally you'll see most of my words are short I don't like a lot of syllables in my stuff but occasionally I want to go for that and then because it's rare you feel it differently um and so that's where that that goes when you say because it's rare Avalanche of automated like those rare more rare words like m a lot of syllables Avalanche automated that is like a it's like coming across it's like going on a walk and coming across like a lizard and you're like that's a Beau I don't see that very often like that I need to look at that now that's how it feels here it's kind of a weird super weird in allergy but but but but but it's like coming across something you don't see very so in the rest of the words it's pretty tight and short and but then there's these occasional things that stand out and I wanted the Avalanche of automated cuz that's how it feels it feels like an avalanche like you're out of control of an avalanche you're caught in it you can't do anything about it of course it's going to be tragic this is not that but it's this barrage it's this Force yep that feels like it never stops when it comes to email so I wanted that's what I want to get at there ain't that right yep also this is something that I think every WR can Implement is whatever your predominant style is if you do the opposite when you want to emphasize something it'll stand out because it is distinct and different yes 100% that's agree I agree with that now email feels like a chore rather than a joy something you fall behind on something you clear out not cherish rather than Delight it you deal with it right agree so more than I would like yeah so this this is where I'm taking email away from the things that are Pleasant like the you know getting an email from a friend hearing from a family member whatever like that's you can Envision that these are now hassles and that's how most people think about email it's like yeah this this is Avalanche of autom stuff all these hassles like yeah this I'm not into email so I'm setting the stage to turn the stage right and flip it around so I want people to go yeah yep again nod their head yeah this sucks I yeah this sucks Sean purri has a line that he shared on this podcast that I really like where he says all stories are about the 5c moment of change and what he's saying is that there's something that happens at the beginning and then the end it will be the opposite of what's going on so take your classic romcom right you have somebody who's in state a and they have all these things going on and by the end of the romcom it'll be the opposite they're going to go through a transformation and that's exactly what we're about to see in the next s point which is and yet email remains a Wonder so I think that what you've done here is you've said this is what's happened with email you sort of set up this pain this annoyance this sort of Agony of having to check your email and now what you're about to do is you have that change into sort of the lightness and the sense of possibility yes and the word wonder and then earlier the word treasure so when we talking about the positive aspects of of email it's like really special positive things they're Enchanted words yes so I I you know I didn't like go through the source to find these they just came out but but but they come out in a way where um um they they are the right words for that statement and I I couldn't come up with better ones I really wanted to think of them that way thanks to email people across cultures continents countries cities and communities C's all C's oh I I I here's another one communicate every day it's reliable it's simple boom boom boom it makes it easy for two humans to share their love and for millions of people to earn a living there you go there's a lot of rhetoric around with paragraph I'm not surprised at all it feels really good it felt really good it came together I love when I've got a couple C's going and then like I got to find some more and the ones I find aren't contrived another se but they are they it's like I didn't reach too far that was clever nice convincing yeah so I but but but the thing is is like I didn't reach like sometimes you you you reach for a you know literation or something and it's like that didn't fit you could tell someone is trying too hard I want to make sure I'm not trying too hard but um that paragraph to me is the is the um the the the the fill the fill someone up with with positivity and like um and and wonder following from the previous you know just like it's it's making it's it's cashing in on what I said earlier and now it's filling that word Wonder with these things so good news the Magic's still there it's just obscured buried under a mess of bad habits and neglect some from people some from machines a lot from email software email deserves a dust off a restoration modernized for the way we email today so let me get into some of those so um neglect goes back to an earlier part in that piece where I said like Gmail I foret like Gmail Apple Yahoo whatever they let it happen right so that's neglect that's that's closing the loop closing the circuit on that um and people aren't going to remember that but I do believe it stays with them in a way where subconsciously there's a closing of a loop there some from people some from machines a lot from email software that if if you look at comedy writers a lot of the way that jokes are structured is they'll have the first two things in a list of three that'll be the same and then the third one breaks the pattern right well I love comedy I'm not a comedy writer but I do maybe it's just something that I absorbed perhaps but really we're about to make email software so up until this point I've have not said what we're going to do I've just said like what it should be so this is the first time I introduced that like the problem is actually also with email software now I still don't actually get deep into that we're going to make email software necessarily but it's a hint as to what we're about to do with this hey.com thing yeah and with hey we've done just that it's a redo a rethink a simplified potent reintroduction of email a fresh start the way it should be hey is our love letter to email and calendars and we're sending it to you on the web Mac Windows Linux IOS and Android yes I added calendar later because we added a calendar later right um it's funny because that's the one I don't like that in there like it's like it feels tacked down I almost stuttered there I was like wait is that there calendars yeah I I'm like we added a calendar so I I did add that um but yeah that's that's it I I barely T the whole point of this even though I want to close the loops is and I knew we had like months to go until we released the thing um I want to First establish that we had this domain hey I want to give people a reason to go there and go what the hell are these guys about to do that was sort of the idea so there's some Clues but not really and uh and and then um it just feels like it it wraps up and then I want to say like it's going to be everywhere that's what all the platforms basically suggest like this is not like just a small thing it's a big thing we're going all out on it yeah the thing that I learned in the last 20 minutes or show as we were doing this was how much you like playing around with the rhythm of words right so you said a redo a rethink prayers and payers all the the these sort of playing around with words of sort of the jetion they're Jabs right it's like a boxing match there Jabs but they're friendly I like that I like the B again to me it's about it's it's a it's a it's a bounce it's this bounce I keep saying the word bounce so it's a getting itive but that's how it feels and I I I like that in a piece I like the motion in a piece um yeah let's talk about this post that you wrote my favorite post you've ever written is called the writing class I'd like to teach yes and basically what you say in it is that you would work with students to take a piece that say five pages and then they' de into one page and then one paragraph one sentence and then maybe even one phrase why would you focus on that idea for for the class to me distilling and editing actually you know I prefer the word distilling more than editing in a sense distill it it's an exercise in distilling something down it's it's very easy to just for some people may not be easy in a sense but you can always add more words to things like get another hour write more words you can write more words even if you they're bad words you can add more words it's harder than to take this thing and chop it down and not lose too much much mean you're going to lose some meaning along the way you might gain some for a while and then you're going to lose some so I kind of this I like this idea of five paragraphs whatever might be two paragraphs too long so when you get to the three paragraph version or whatever or what pick a number it doesn't matter it could be five to four to three to two whatever it is there's a point it's like a kind of a bell curvy thing where there's a point where like this is actually getting better and then there's also a point where you've gone too far and so I want people to experience all of that which is getting better and then going too far and realizing that it's still a good exercise like can I boil this down to one sentence can I boil it down to one word um even though it's not practical it's still a good thing to go through I just like in all the writing classes I ever took which was not that many it was just the required ones in high school and college whatever it was always just right right right and then like do a second draft do a third draft whatever whatever it was like the formal process it was never about make this tighter brief ER shorter more concise more distilled um more pointed it was never about that and I always wondered why not like isn't that really what we should be aiming to do um so that's why I thought this course should exist and it's the one I want to write or one I'd want to teach if I ever taught one um or I mean again I like wrote this in a way like go ahead you teach it I I don't it's isn't my I mean it's I don't know if it's my idea wherever it was but like go take it I hope someone else does this yeah um because I think it's important and also another I wrote another one about iteration um which is a similar idea like if I was to teach just any class at all it would be about iteration it'd be take something a project pick a project I don't care it could be about rocks it could be about trees it could be about furniture turn it in the whole semester is just making it better versus in school for the most part at least in my experience it's like turn the assignment in onto the next assignment turn the next assignment onto the next assignment turn the assignment in onto the next assignment but if you're working on something in life you're typically kind of working on the same thing for a while and you want to keep making it better and better and better so the idea of teaching iteration giving people practice and iteration is kind of what the writing class is but it's also a broader idea of working with this thing a little bit more I mean you've been doing base camp for what 27 years 25 years base camp itself has been 20 years the company's been 25 years yeah but yeah 20 years of base camp multiple versions along the way um and we've made other products since but yeah base camp has been iterated on and iterated and it's it's a true joy and pleasure to really hone something like that to really get something right like that um and to like take a I always think about it Tim a piece of furnature like you take a piece of wood you get this piece of lumber and you sand it down and you sand it down you feel it and how does it feel and how does it look and you hold it different angles and you I can make this better I can make this better and you just keep doing that until it's in that case it might be done software doesn't really have the same end point perhaps as as a piece of wood at some point it's all gone if you sand it all away but this idea that you can keep working this thing uh and and not just like put it aside move on to the next thing the other thing that I like about it so there's two things actually the first thing is it forces you to understand the essence of what you're trying to say and then the other thing is when you do that I think that you stumble on things that you wouldn't have found had you not been forced to compress and I think that you did this in your once letter you said once upon a time once once once yeah that is in one word that is the one word description of what I'm going for and you also could have said you could have titled that like against the Church of recurring revenue and actually not even had those words in the piece but against the Church of recurring Revenue would have been a one- sentence summary of what's in the piece and I'm trying to make a point here which is that often the distillation is like emergent property it's it's not just taking the parts and making them smaller you could have the distillation words not even be in the piece yes that's often times what what a headline is and this is actually one of the most interesting things for me when I was writing for Inc magazine I didn't realize this but I didn't get to write the headlines I knew this eventually but editors write the headlines and the headlines are often like not in the piece and it was kind of cool to see that which is someone else's distillation of this thing you wrote that's this long now it's this long m and uh and this is what they think it is now of course there's like linkbait and there's all other things that kind of poison that world and that well to some degree um but I think it's a great Point um you you are sort of squeezing something out and and in some ways what's what what remains and what comes out are different things and the drop that comes out could summarize the whole thing and maybe that's the one liner or the one word you know yeah and it could be a different word that is not represented I like that right it's a good point sap to syrup right it takes 40 gallons of sap to make syrup and syrup is just distinctly different from sap it is it is good point they're two s words too tell me about how writing is in your hiring process it's actually the first thing we look at the first thing the first thing oh how about that because um I don't look at rums we look at cover letters the first thing now of course if someone's going to apply and like for a programming role and they're not a programmer that's a problem but the first thing we look at is not the resume it's how have they responded to our call for applications and we say like write a cover letter and if the cover letter is written in a way where it's a generic cover letter they're gone immediately um even if it's well written if we can tell that it was like written for anyone and they just replaced our name I'm just not interested in that person and we might lose good people because of that but it's okay I'm not interested in that I want someone who said I'm going to write something to them uh I'm going to say something to them and so that is the first filter it's their writing ability their ability to communicate who they are what they're about why they're applying and if it's like dear hiring manager like that's a problem and if it's like very generic and buzzwordy that's a problem it's really the best filter we found to get to the kind of person that we want to hire uh not every company's going to want to hire like we hire but we know that the majority of our communication is written and we write a lot and turn in a lot of different ways and we found that the best way not to waste time is to write something right the first time versus having someone write something you're like what what does that mean and they have to rewrite it and like re explain it or they say it they write it in a wrong way that freaks people out and then someone else says so explain I want to cut all that out from the beginning so it's a very important thing and in every position we hire the best writer wow I mean we they have if there's a tiebreaker the best writer gets gets a not yeah is there a lot of long form writing that you're doing or is most of the writing multi- paragraphs sort of in base camp and um there's like I mean long form for us is I don't know 800 words 1,200 words something that's like a pitch an idea yes um uh every six weeks every team lead it has to write what's called a heartbeat which is quite a long thing it can be quite long summarizing all the work their team did over the last 6 weeks and the way that's written is really important because this is how we disseminate information internally we don't don't have meetings there's no status meetings it's all written up it's all published to base camp internally so people can read it on their own schedule on their own time but it has to be good this is really like the summary of our company's activities over the last six weeks and we would never have ai do this this is not a summary of tasks or a summary of output it's someone's own words this is very important to us so it's someone's own words and so there's a lot of that kind of writing and there's shorter writing too a lot of commentary and whatever but but it's the long form if you can't write long form you can't work at base camp yeah yep what makes one of those heartbeats good usually it's a that's a really good question because there's a few people who write really really good ones and I'm like why why are these so good first of all there's personality in them it's not just a summary like it's not like a computer summary of things it's like this person work on this this was really hard we were trying to break through this idea we couldn't get there they really nailed it or they put in some extra effort to make this better for someone else there's a lot of things that are about helping others whenever I read heartbeats it's like this person helped this person solve a problem I'm just like it just inspires me it's great and it feels like the writing is better um and usually they're s they short summaries but they get to it in a way where like I'm like I know exactly what happened I wasn't paying attention to this thing at all for 6 weeks and in this amount of writing with these people who who are referenced in it I know what happened that's how it has to feel and there should be some personality like I should know who wrote this like I Can Tell Rosa Rosa writes these incredible heartbeats her writing is so good uh and and like I go that's yep Rosa wrote that I don't even need to see who wrote it like I know Rosa wrote that or Brian wrote this like I can just tell so there needs that needs to come through um we're very anti- internally very anti like AI style writing like I don't I don't want convenience I don't want convenience I want people's own words the people who I work with who I talk to every day I want their words in the in their choice of words there is more meaning because I know it came from them so there's there's something to that that's really important to us the other thing that's great about writing internally especially long form this is I think lost in so many people is that when you do things orally so if you're if you're having a meeting which is how most companies communicate it's only good for the people in the room and someone say well you can have a transcript well okay maybe or you can record it like it to go back if you're a new employee joining the company 8 months from now and you want to go back and like understand how this company runs to watch like to try to watch 40 hours of boring ass video from a meeting it's you're not going to do it but you might skim and read some things and see some things catch your eye the institutional knowledge that's built up in long form writing is wonderful for the future it's good for now but it's so useful for new employees to get up to speed quickly on how the company communicates writes shares by looking at the evidence of past people doing that versus if you weren't there you missed it or hey watch this 45 minute video W with like you know three minutes of good stuff in it who's going to do all that you know so I I think it's so valuable and it's searchable and it's just it's easy to access and it's easy to link to and point out and share with someone else it's just so transferable that that I think it's a wonderful thing to do and I don't think enough companies do it or they do it in the boring business way we've been talking about where there's like no conveyance of real information there's just a lot of words and it's like I don't know what I just read I'm no wiser for it I'm I'm worse off for it I wasted time and I don't get it that's most companies right and I think it's a shame real shame and a real probably like at the core of a ton of lost productivity in the economy so if I came to you and I said I wrote one of these heartbeats and the ideas were fine but I was writing like an AI I was writing with that sort of sterilized posturing business writing sense how would you coach me to get to a place where I'm writing the kind of heartbeat that is uh worthy of your attention yeah well first of all I would just it's a very simple I'd say just tell me because I think that um most people don't have any problems communicating like just talking it out like so what did you do last week or tell me about the project last six weeks or whatever it was like and they would just like loosen up and and say it they wouldn't struggle through it they'd recall some things they'd say some things I'd say just write that down instead like it's it's such a cut through it's like so easy to get to what someone really wants to say by just saying it

## ABRIDGED EXAMPLE OUTPUT FROM THIS INPUT

### IDEAS

- Don't write, communicate.

- Think about the end product of writing, but not the process so much.

- If you don't get to something good quick, throw it away and start again.

- If you hit a barrier when writing that's a signal to stop, not to push through.

- Often times I come back to a blank page rather than where I left off.

- Essentially if you're stuck with trying to get an idea out you're not channeling the pure wisdom of it, so you want to come back and try again and it might happen then.

- There is a state, often when you wake up or read something, where the idea is so clear, and it's critical that you write at that moment when the wisdom is clear. Don't try to write when it's not clear.

- Trust the flow and ride it.

- Trust what looks and feels right in a sentence or whatever.

- When a flow comes to you, respect it and ride it because that's when the wisdom is coming through clearly.

- If you feel yourself artificially trying to make something happen, you have to stop yourself and go back to what's natural.

- Most things that are good come out of the intuitive world.

- Anger and frustration is a great source of truth or wisdom. So you need inputs coming in that spawn ideas.

- The early short version is usually the best version, and if you keep writing you think you're improving it but you're often making it worse.

- Don't depart from the length or format or whatever that you do well.

- You shouldn't set out to write a book; write the content that's natural and then assemble the book.

- Good writing is knowing what is natural to you and being ok with doing that. Don't mimic or copy because that might now be your thing.

- School teaches us to write about things we don't care about, and that's a horrible thing to learn.

- Write the way you speak, and think about how to explain it verbally. 

- Find a hook that gets you excited about the idea, and reminds you of the core wisdom of the idea, and that will be enough to propel you through the piece.

- The best way to write clearly is to write the way you speak.

- It's even ok to publish an imperfect piece even with a spelling error. You can fix it later.

- If you stumble in life you keep going, you don't back up and start again.

- Avoid making things too sterile or perfect. Often times by doing that you're removing the authenticity that makes it good. That's why writing like you speak is very pure.

- Don't be afraid to throw away work. Just start a new document.

- You don't have to keep to-do lists because if it's important enough you'll be reminded.

- Write when you have something to say. Wisdom will prompt you through quality inputs.

- It's hard to write from 11-1 because you need to be inspired.

- Compressed timeframes are great because they might force your inspiration

- A lot of bad writing comes from writing courses in school where they teach you to try to sound smart.

- Writing training never really teaches you how to write in your own voice based on something you actually care about. It's all based on pretending, which is super harmful.

- This might be responsible for a massive amount of inefficiency in business!

- A bit part of bad writing is people simply not having anything to say, so they're forced to posture and pretend.

- Many people are in business and doing things without knowing why, which means they won't be good at writing about that thing.

- A single line like "Something happened to business software" is great because it can remind you what you wanted to say. It's like a hook that keeps your muse working.

- A big problem with producing inspired writing is forgetting your inspiration, which is why it's so important to either capture it or have a hook statement / sentence that reminds you.

- Using analogies like renting vs. buying software is a powerful way to convey an idea.

- Alliteration is a powerful mechanism for being memorable.

- Magic phrases like Church of Recurring Revenue can also be extremely memorable.

- Good writing is about transferring revelations and emotions to the reader.

- Start with getting them to agree about the state of something, and once they're head nodding, then you introduce your main idea.

- Distilling is a powerful exercise because it forces you to know what the main idea actually is.

- Often the distillation of something, like into a headline, could be bigger than the writing itself, as an emergent property.

- Filter employees based on how well they articulate their desire to work there in a hand-written cover letter.

- Writing is so key to the company that if all else fails, go with the better long-form writer.

- If you ever get caught up on how to write something, just talk it out and record that.

- Use the test of "would I ever say this to someone in person" as a way of self-editing your own writing. Again, write like you talk.

- People filter themselves by what they think is "professional" but what does that really mean? Just write like you speak and you'll be clearer and more authentic.

- Another technique for writing well is to just share your secrets. Top chefs give their recipes and it doesn't hurt them; it helps them. Your secrets are (usually) not sacred, and sharing them is endearing rather than harmful.

- It's a lot more dangerous to not be known or to not have content out there then to reveal your "secrets".

- It's interesting to study islands because they evolved on their own without copying everything around them.

- Be cautious of copying and following people too much. Know when to become your own island and follow your own principles vs. when to take inspiration inputs.

### INSIGHTS

- Wisdom is precious and it comes to you unpredictably. You need to learn to ride it when it happens.

- The best way to get wisdom inspired is to consume high quality inputs that spawn ideas within yourself—often in the form of disagreeing with an idea someone else had.

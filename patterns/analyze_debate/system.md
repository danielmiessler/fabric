- Map out all the claims and implications on a virtual whiteboard in your mind.
- Analyze the claims from a neutral and unbiased perspective.

# OUTPUT

- Your output should contain the following:

    - A score that tells the user how insightful and interesting this debate is from 0 (not very interesting and insightful) to 10 (very interesting and insightful). 
    This should be based on factors like "Are the participants trying to exchange ideas and perspectives and are trying to understand each other?", "Is the debate about novel subjects that have not been commonly explored?" or "Have the participants reached some agreement?". 
    Hold the scoring of the debate to high standards and rate it for a person that has limited time to consume content and is looking for exceptional ideas. 
    This must be under the heading "INSIGHTFULNESS SCORE (0 (not very interesting and insightful) to 10 (very interesting and insightful))".
